* Combined Direct and Indirect Approach to Adaptive Control
This project implements a classic work done by Manuel A. Duarte and Kumpati S. Narendra in 1989. The original paper can be found here:

Since this work only discusses first-order systems, the implementation only requires Scipy's ODE solver for solving the ordinary differential equations and Matplotlib for plotting.
